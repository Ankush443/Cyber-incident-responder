A comprehensive real-time security system designed to detect, analyze, and automatically respond to cyber threats using AI-powered analytics.

## Overview

The AI Cyber-Incident Responder system provides an end-to-end solution for cybersecurity incident response:

1. **Real-time Log Analysis**: Continuously monitors system logs for suspicious activities
2. **AI-Powered Detection**: Leverages AI to identify potential security threats
3. **Automated Response**: Executes pre-defined response actions to mitigate threats
4. **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Electron-based UI for monitoring and manual intervention

## Key Features

- **Streaming Architecture**: Built on Fluvio for high-throughput event processing
- **AI Analysis Engine**: Processes raw logs to identify attack patterns and anomalies
- **WebSocket Real-time Updates**: Instant alerts delivered to operators
- **Secure Agent Communication**: mTLS and command signing for secure remote execution
- **Playbook Automation**: Pre-defined response sequences for common threat types
- **Electron UI**: Cross-platform desktop application for monitoring and response

## Architecture

```
Raw Logs → AI Processor → Alerts → API/WebSocket Gateway → Frontend UI & Terminator Agent
```

The system uses a microservices architecture with the following components:
- **Stream Ingest**: Collects logs from various sources
- **AI Processor**: Analyzes logs for security threats
- **API Server**: Handles WebSocket communication and action execution
- **Terminator Agent**: Executes response actions on target systems
- **Electron UI**: Provides monitoring and manual response capabilities

## Quick Start

See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for detailed setup instructions and deployment options.

## Security Features

- **Log Validation**: Prevents forgery of security logs
- **PKI Infrastructure**: mTLS for secure agent communication
- **JWT Authentication**: Short-lived tokens for UI access
- **Command Signing**: Ed25519 signatures with daily key rotation
